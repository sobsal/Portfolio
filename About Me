My name is Alex Sobil.  I graduated from Santa Clara University in 2019 with a degree in computer science, emphaisizing in cybersecurity.
I've worked on projects in school in C++ and C and worked on personal projects in python.  I enjoy doing data analysis and visualizing data.
My main professional experience comes from supporting a business manager on an alumni development program at UCSB that generates 
$1 million dollars in revenue every year.  I'm currently seeking a role as a software engineer or software developer to get more
professional experience.  I see myself in five years as a cybersecurity analyst.
