My name is Alex Sobil.  I am a recent graduate from Santa Clara University with a bachelor’s degree in computer science, emphasizing in cybersecurity.  I worked on projects there in C++ and have done my own data analysis in my own time in python.
I’ve supported a business manager for 3 years at UCSB during one of their alumni development programs that generates over a million dollars during its duration with over 2000 patrons a year.  I worked in Excel there.
I’m currently seeking a role as a software engineer or developer to further my experience to eventually become a cybersecurity analyst.
